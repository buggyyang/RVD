- Codebase for: Diffusion Probabilistic Modeling for Video Generation
- The codebase contain necessary codes for both training and sampling.
- Part of the code is adapted from [this codebase](https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch).
- Trained model comes later
- **Future update will be moved to our [group repo](https://github.com/mandt-lab/RVD)**
